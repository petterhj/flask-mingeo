Simple geolocation tool using the [Geolocation Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation). 

Initially made back in 2014 allowing users to share their current position anonymously to one or more observers. Later reworked for Python 3 with Google Maps replaced by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)/[OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
